## Bugs

- On screens larger than 1400px, the layout of the website stretches disproportionately, causing elements to misalign and affect the overall design and usability of the site.

-Several commit messages in the version control history do not adhere to the standard set by the Code Institute. This impacts the clarity and traceability of changes made to the codebase.

## Unfixed Bugs
- Viewport Stretching on Screens Larger Than 1400px and its not fixed because Adequate testing on various screen sizes and devices needs to be conducted to confirm that changes address the problem effectively without introducing new issues.

- Non-Standard Commit Messages was the result of lack of awareness or understanding of the required commit message standards of code institue.After discussing with my mentor, it has been noted that recent commit messages have shown significant improvement. The team has made progress in aligning with the Code Instituteâ€™s standards, with a more consistent and descriptive format now being used.

> [!NOTE]  
> There are no remaining bugs that I am aware of.
